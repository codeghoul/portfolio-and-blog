This repository forms the backbone of my personal website and blog, www.jysh.me, encompassing a wide range of topics. It incorporates technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet, and Hygraph to create an interactive and informative online presence. The content covers portfolio development, live website implementation, static site generation, and the integration of geographic mapping (Leaflet) and data visualization (Hygraph) for enhanced user experiences.
